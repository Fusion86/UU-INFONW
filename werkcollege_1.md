# 1. John-von-Neumann – the infinite computation loop

1. 97%
2. between 2% en 10% when running geekbench5
3. when running a benchmark you are fully utilizing the full capabilities of your processor, which means that it has less time to be idle.
4. We didn't find an idle process on linux. We did find `idle_inject` though we think this is unrelated.
5. ...

# 2. Computer components

1. Mouse, keyboard, wii mote, playstation controller, webcam, microphone, lg g29 steeringwheel
2. Monitor, speaker, wii mote, DAC, rgb toetsenbord, bios speaker
3. x86_64 desktop cpu's like Intel core i7 6700k and ryzen 5900x
4. 1. Yes they are
   2. No, they are all part of the SoC.
   3. a. cpu core muliplier, core voltage, tdp limit, base clock, turbo boost, vtx/vtt, hyperthreading/smt
      b. xmp profile, timings, voltage, frequency

# 7. Digital Arithmetics

1. 0b1111 0110
2. Pro: Easy to invert and read numbers. Con: hard to math
3. 0b1111 0110
4. Pro: Also easy to invert. Con: math doesn't quite add up
5. 0b0001 0101
6. Pro: math fully checks out. Con: inverting number takes 1 more step (flip bits and then add 1)
